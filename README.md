# Module 12 - Web Scraping Challenge
## Summary

Analyzing the weather data is great but, how can we show off our hard work?  In this challenge I built an interactive web page that allows viewers to easily navigate the layers of my work.  
- The site contains:
  - a responsive home page with a drop down click menu
  - visualization pages for key concepts
  - clickable images for easy navigation

- Key technologies include:
  - BootStrap js library
  - Cascading Style Sheets CSS
  - Jupyter Notebook with Pandas
  - Github Pages
